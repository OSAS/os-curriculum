SEEKING ALL TEACHERS, STUDENTS, ETC WHO WANT TO GET EXPERIENCE AND ADD TO THIS BASE OF KNOWLEDGE
Glad you want to contribute!

## The easy way:
Feel free to make issues if you have small additions/suggestions (ex: a great web-reference / URL) related to teaching and learning open source.

## The web way:
Login to the github.com and click the Pencil icon on any file you want to edit (The pencil icon says "Fork this project and edit the file" when you hover over it).

## The pro way:
Fork our repo, make edits to files locally, and send us pull requests!
We promise to do all we can to include your addition or provide feedback.

## Pull requests tips
* Context in Description; Please assure that any non-trivial pull requests have a good contextual explanation in the 'description' field
* Tell a story; as to why this was added, or how you came about finding the material; This gives us context and understanding as to why we should include it
* Commit early and often; If you have many edits to separate unrelated files, try to break up the commits or pulls by the various subject matters; Its harder to quickly accept monolithic pulls with multiple pieces of unrelated content
