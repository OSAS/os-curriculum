This is an example topic, filled out with the beginings of some content.

== Legal Frameworks for Open Source
In order to create open source software or contribute to open source projects, 
students need to understand open source licenses and how they work.  
This becomes especially important as they begin to reference and use other open source code.

A good backgrounder for instructors on [this topic] is [insert reference], for a deeper understanding see Readings & Resources below.

=== Prior knowledge assumed:
Here we would list what specific information students should know or skills they should have before you teach this module.

* Assumption 1
* Assumption 2
* etc.

=== Instructional tools:
Here we will list any tools or demos that you might use to illustrate concepts that pertain to this topic.
These may include videos, simulations, games, etc.

We'll research these but may also need to reach out to instructors to round up ones you know about.

=== Key learning objectives:
Here we will list the key learning objectives for this topic.  Where appropriate we will distinguish between beginner, intermediate and advanced levels and/or coding- vs. culture-focused classes.

* learning objective 1 (level)
* learning objective 2 (level)
* learning objective 3 (level, culture)
* etc.

This is a part where we'll need to reach out to instructors to help determine good learning objectives.

=== Readings & Resources:
This is a list of all the pertinent, relevant learning resources for this topic. 
Ex: Links to web content, research or traditional text books.

These links will be curated and constantly updated by Red Hat

.Each resource should have:
* a name
* link
* topics / tags (from a curated list), including whether it's better for basic or advanced students and whether it's practical or theory-based
* description of content that explains when the resource in question would be useful

=== Community Interaction or Exercises:
We see this being two sections:  if your class is participating in an open source project (which we hope everyone is, of course), then you do A.  If not (if, for instance, a regular prof teaching a regular class finds this content and wants to use it in his course), they do B.

A. For classes participating in an open source project:  see module 3 [[all of these need to be built -- this is the framework part of interacting with an open source community]].  Module 3 would be about Topic 1.
B. For classes not participating in an open source project, here are some exercises you might do to reinforce this topic:

.Exercise 1:
* Description of Exercise
* Intended Result
* etc.

Will definitely need help here -- will borrow as much from POSSE and RIT as possible

=== Teaching Notes:
Here's where we can point out the parts we'd emphasize; analogies that work, etc. etc.  

=== Rubrics:
There should be clear mastery criteria defined for each learning objective defined above.
