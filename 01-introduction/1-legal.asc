== Legal Frameworks for Open Source
In order to create open source software or contribute to open source projects, 
students need to understand open source licenses and how they work.  
This becomes especially important as they begin to reference and use other open source code.

A good backgrounder for instructors on the legal framework for open source is http://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source, for a deeper understanding see Resources below.

=== Prior knowledge assumed:
Assumes student understands the term "open source."  Assumes...

=== Instructional tools:
 * Choose-a-license game ...
 * Whatever whatever

=== Key learning objectives:

Students understand:

 * when something is considered copyrighted in the US
 * differences between copyright and trademark and why that's important for open source
 * the basic framework for all open source licenses
 * the major types of open source licenses
 * what resources are appropriate to use when choosing a license
 ** if appropriate, the student should be able to select a license
 * how to review software for licensing issues

=== Readings & Resources:
This is a list of all the pertinent, relevant learning resources for this topic. 
Ex: Links to web content, research or traditional text books.

These links will be curated and constantly updated by Red Hat

.Each resource should have:
* a name
* link
* topics / tags (from a curated list), including whether it's better for basic or advanced students and whether it's practical or theory-based
* description of content that explains when the resource in question would be useful

=== Community Interaction or Exercises:
We see this being two sections:  if your class is participating in an open source project (which we hope everyone is, of course), then you do A.  If not (if, for instance, a regular prof teaching a regular class finds this content and wants to use it in his course), they do B.

A. For classes participating in an open source project:  see module 3 [[all of these need to be built -- this is the framework part of interacting with an open source community]].  Module 3 would be about Topic 1.
B. For classes not participating in an open source project, here are some exercises you might do to reinforce this topic:

.Exercise 1:
* Description of Exercise
* Intended Result
* etc.

Will definitely need help here -- will borrow as much from POSSE and RIT as possible

=== Teaching Notes:
Here's where we can point out the parts we'd emphasize; analogies that work, etc. etc.  

=== Rubrics:
There should be clear mastery criteria defined for each learning objective defined above.
