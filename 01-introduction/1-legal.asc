== Legal Frameworks for Open Source
In order to create open source software or contribute to open source projects, 
students need to understand open source licenses and how they work.  
This becomes especially important as they begin to reference and use other open source code.

A good backgrounder for instructors on the legal framework for open source is http://www.rosenlaw.com/oslbook.htm[Rosenlaws ''Open Source Licensing'' handbook]. For a deeper understanding see Resources below.
