=============

Teaching open source to students and interested parties is a challenge. This project focuses on resources and examples for the professional higher-ed landscape. Sometimes, the first step is in getting the teachers educated and able to access organized OSS-related resources for their classes. This project attempts to be that resource. 

Much of the content around what open source is, and how it is done already exist. Instead of rehasing all of this information, this project will act as a central, curated, and organized location that links off to other expert resources. It will establish what is important around open source, what the key topics are, where you can go to learn about these topics, and then dive into real-world teacher/classroom exercizes, tools, best practices and grading rubrics.

The content is as much meant to be 'cherry-picked' or ala-carte, as it is a full curriculum. We expect that teachers and classrooms will each create their own unique curriculum with the pieces that we provide here.
